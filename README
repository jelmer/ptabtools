	ptabtools 0.4
=====================
This package contains a couple of utilities for converting PowerTab files
as generated by the PowerTab editor, to GNU Lilypond, ASCII, MusicXML and 
plain XML and also includes a library that can be used by other programs for 
accessing PowerTab files.

The parser works for all the files I could find. If you find any that 
crashes it, please send it to me.

The various conversion utilities are still very much alpha --- their 
output is erroneous. Patches in this area are most welcome.

Available utilities:
 - ptbinfo : Shows general info about a PowerTab file
 - ptb2ly : Convert PowerTab file to GNU Lilypond file
 - ptb2ascii : Generate an ASCII Tab file
 - ptb2xml : Convert PowerTab file to an XML file that resembles the PowerTab binary format
 - ptb2musicxml : Convert to XML file that validates against the MusicXML DTD

Enjoy!
